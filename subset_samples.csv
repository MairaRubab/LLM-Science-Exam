28,What is the evidence for the existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy?,"The Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center because of the bright flare activity observed near Sagittarius A*. The radius of the central object must be less than 17 light-hours, because otherwise S2 would collide with it. Observations of the star S14 indicate that the radius is no more than 6.25 light-hours, about the diameter of Uranus' orbit. No known astronomical object other than a black hole can contain 4.0 million M☉ in this volume of space.","The Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center because the star S14 follows an elliptical orbit with a period of 15.2 years and a pericenter of 17 light-hours from the center of the central object. From the motion of star S14, the object's mass can be estimated as 4.0 million M☉, or about 7.96×1036 kg. The radius of the central object must be less than 17 light-hours, because otherwise S14 would collide with it. Observations of the star S2 indicate that the radius is no more than 6.25 light-hours, about the diameter of Uranus' orbit.
